[ ] Finish Milestone 3 for Project 6

We started class by taking a 5 question mini quiz regarding creative development that was a mix of conceptual questions and understanding benefits of certain methods or practices in code. We then went over the questions to understand each answer choice and why the correct one/ones are the right choices. We were then given time to work on Project 6


Signing-off. Got some good work done and feel confident in catching up/finishing up MS 2 for Project 6
