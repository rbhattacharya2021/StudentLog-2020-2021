We started class by going over the plan for the week including going over more grading for the AP project before going into breakout rooms to grade with classmates

Signing-off. We graded a practice AP Project that received a full 6 points, though receiving a point for row 6 was 50/50, which allows for a good resource to know what classifies as a perfect project, will continue later
