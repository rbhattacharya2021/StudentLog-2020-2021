We started class going over an overlook of what the week is going to look like. Some notable stuff is that the entire Project is due before Thursday class, and that we will be spending class time taking a formative 35 question quiz. We also found out that we will be starting Project 7 next week.

Signing-off. I got caught up with everything and introduced to the two extra credit puzzles (KGOG-TV and TEC REDSHIFT), so I need to now choose which one to do before Thursday. I have played around with each, but I am not sure which one I want to do. I also need to make sure to go back and look at all my code to make sure my comments are accurate and that I properly give credit to any code that I did not come up with, will continue later
